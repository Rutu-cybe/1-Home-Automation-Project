# Home-Automation-Project
This is the very first project of my life. This is my graduation project. I remember that at the time I was very excited about this. This is not only a project for me, but it is my emotions. At that time, I faced many errors and obstacles. But I faced it and did my project. So it is about IoT. I used the Arduino Uno and the GSMmodule. We can control home appliances using an Arduino Uno and gsm. This was commanded by a mobile phone. This is used inside and outside of the home. This is a precious project for my heart.I also added a clapping feature to it. If we clap then the lights are on and we have to again clap to stop the lights.
